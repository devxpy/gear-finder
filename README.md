# gear-finder
Requires python3 to run
Start by entering the gear teeth information in the 'Modify gearset' window from the Options Menu.
Select appropriate Gearset from the drop down menu.
Enter ratio and the Tolerance you desire and press 'Find'.
(It may take some time if you have a large gearset. I recommend using pypy if you have performance issues)
Everything is conviniently saved inside a log for future reference.
