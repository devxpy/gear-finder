# gear-finder
Start by entering the gear teeth information in the 'Configure gearset' window. Don't forget to save your prefrences.
Select appropriate Gearset from the drop down menu.
Enter ratio and the Tolerance you desire and press 'Find'.
(It may take some time if you have a large gearset. The window doesn't hang up, it just needs a little time. I recommend using pypy if you have performance issues)
Everything is conviniently saved inside a log for future reference.
A small number must appear on the bottom right corner indicating the number of results found.
